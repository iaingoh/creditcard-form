## Credit Card Payment Form in HTML & CSS

This is a very basic HTML form styled with simple CSS meant for rudimentary credit card and paypal payments.

### Fields:
- Payment type
  - Visa, MC, AMEX, Discover, Paypal
- Name
- Card Number
- Expiration Date
- Security Code 

### Font Awesome

I used used font awesome icons for the credit card types, Visa, Mastercard, etc. There was no color generically, and would require additional CSS to color the icons. I decided not to do it because this would be a simple form to demonstrate HTML capability and some CSS.

### To Do

- I've been trying to center the entire form. Center it in the viewport.I think it's been hard to do so, because of the input's text type. When centering text elements, there are differences in how to do so.
- I've not used bootstrap so far, i want to use CSS, to learn the intricacies of CSS styling.
